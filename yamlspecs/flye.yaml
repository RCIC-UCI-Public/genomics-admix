  description: |
    Flye {{version}} is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads,
    such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is
    designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to 
    large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline.
    It takes raw PacBio/ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs. Flye
    also has a special mode for metagenome assembly
