  description: |
    StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments
    into potential transcripts. It uses a novel network flow algorithm as well as an
    optional de novo assembly step to assemble and quantitate full-length transcripts
    representing multiple splice variants for each gene locus.
