  description: |
    PLINK/SEQ is an open-source C/C++ library for working with human genetic variation data. 
    The specific focus is to provide a platform for analytic tool development for variation data 
    from large-scale resequencing projects, particularly whole-exome and whole-genome studies. 
    However, the library could in principle be applied to other types of genetic studies, 
    including whole-genome association studies of common SNPs.
