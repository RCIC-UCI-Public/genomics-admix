    Diamond {{version}} is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, 
    designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key features are: 
    o Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-20,000x speed of BLAST.
    o Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
    o Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard desktops or laptops.
    o Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML, as well as taxonomic classification.
